THe real code really can be credited to the program below.

NirCmd: https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html
/////

This source just extracts the nircmd binary and runs 
"mutesysvolume 0 default_record".
The reason I made this was because sometimes my microphone just gets muted by windows; I have no clue what truly causes it to get muted; maybe a hardware function on my mic? But regardless; 

I just setup a razer launch program key on my keyboard which runs the exe which does the rest; effectively functioning as a shortcut instead of going into the sound settings and unmutting the microphone.
